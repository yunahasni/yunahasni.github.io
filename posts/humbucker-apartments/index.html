Some of the most common types of apartments include one, two, three, four, five, and six bedroom units. There are also studio apartments and townhouses to be found in cities and large metropolitan areas. One of the most important factors when choosing an apartment is its location. Units that are close to transportation or other amenities are often more affordable than ones located further away from all these things. Another important factor to consider is what type of apartment the tenant will be using.

A kitchen is a vital part of any apartment, and should include everything you need for cooking food (pots, pans, utensils, etc.), as well as storage space for your dishes and cookware.
