bedroom size and layout can affect the number of bedrooms.
Small apartments can have one or two bedrooms, while larger properties may have three or four bedrooms. The size of a bedroom affects both the number of bedrooms and the amount of living space that is available. The layout of a bedroom also affects the amount of space that is available for storage.
The layout of a bedroom also affects how comfortable it will be to sleep in. A small bedroom with a shared hallway between it and the rest of the apartment will likely be less comfortable than one with its own hallway and separate bed room.
