Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=emory-woods-at-rtp-apartments---durham-nc-27713>Emory Woods At RTP Apartments - Durham, NC 27713<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#emory-woods-at-rtp-apartments---durham-nc-27713>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image.apartmentguide.com/imgr/cd3e06203ad59facbd9e7ba0c0269f5a/ onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.RraHRG58f0Cxh9dDqHEnTAHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Emory Woods at RTP Apartments - Durham, NC 27713"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>emory woods rtp durham apartments nc.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a housing option for those who cannot or do not want to live in a home.
