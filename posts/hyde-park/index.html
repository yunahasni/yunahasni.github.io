This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.\nPhotos - The Hyde Park Apartment Homes Source: hydeparkdenison.com\n.\nAging and health concerns: As people age, there are more and more concerns over their health.

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=photos---the-hyde-park-apartment-homes-6>Photos - The Hyde Park Apartment Homes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#photos---the-hyde-park-apartment-homes-6>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://hydeparkdenison.com/images/b3-11med.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bPNZtVL6qiGq9DoH1lbnOwHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Photos - The Hyde Park Apartment Homes"><p><em>Source: hydeparkdenison.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Aging and health concerns:
