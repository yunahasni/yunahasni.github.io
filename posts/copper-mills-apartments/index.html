There are a variety of apartments available in the city. They can be classified based on their function, size, and exterior design. Here are four examples:</p><ol><li>Houses- These are typically small, two- or three-bedroom apartments that sit on a small plot of land. Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. They&rsquo;re perfect for people who want to live close to the center of town but don&rsquo;t need all the amenities that condos offer.</li></ol><h2 id=copper-mill-village-apartments--apartments-in-high-point-nc>Copper Mill Village Apartments | Apartments In High Point, NC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#copper-mill-village-apartments--apartments-in-high-point-nc>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/3/662443/New Photo 15.jpg?crop=(0,0,300,200)&cropxunits=300&cropyunits=200&" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MTZsMVto_dL7nn9_dUilZwHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Copper Mill Village Apartments | Apartments in High Point, NC"><p><em>Source: coppermill-apts.com</em></p><blockquote><p>village.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance and cleaning fees:

One of these is the maintenance and cleaning fees that may be required by the landlord. In addition, other factors such as distance from work or school might also influence these costs.
