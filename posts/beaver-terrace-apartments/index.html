An apartment is a rental property that typically provides one or more bedrooms, living spaces, and a kitchenette. Apartments are a great way to find affordable housing in a city or town. They can be rented out for short-term rentals, as well.
Apartments come in different sizes and styles. Some have larger living areas with kitchenettes, while others have smaller bedrooms and kitchens. The key thing to keep in mind when choosing an apartment is the space it provides. If you need more than one bedroom, make sure the apartment has at least two of those!</p><h2 id=beaver-terrace-apartments---state-college-pa--apartmentscom-1>Beaver Terrace Apartments - State College, PA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beaver-terrace-apartments---state-college-pa--apartmentscom-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/XJnPb7YMzlD6F-ifD8N9vVuWQgAwOuhey_NLsZr8Bj8/111/beaver-terrace-state-college-pa-primary-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.CV-XiSTSVhc2ViO011OoNgHaF1&pid=15.1"' alt="Beaver Terrace Apartments - State College, PA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>buying or using an apartment
