To start, make a list of what you need in an apartment: kitchenette, bedroom and living room. Once you have that down, it&rsquo;s time to start looking at the prices and see if it&rsquo;s right for you.</li><li>Consider the location:
Once you&rsquo;ve determined what you need, consider the location of your apartment. Not all apartments are created equal and may not be available in every city or town. Be sure to research each one before making a decision.</li><li>Research the reviews:
Before making your final decision, take some time to check out the reviews of your potential apartments to get an idea of how others have felt about them.
