Financing an apartment can be tricky, but there are a few key things to keep in mind if you&rsquo;re planning on getting one. The first thing to think about is your budget. You&rsquo;ll want to figure out how much you can afford to spend on rent and other expenses each month, and then compare that against the monthly mortgage or lease payments you&rsquo;ll need to make. Next, consider the size of your apartment. If you&rsquo;re looking for a smaller rental property, it might be easier to get a mortgage or lease with a shorter term than if you&rsquo;re looking for a larger one. Finally, make sure you have your current address and current credit score before applying for a mortgage or lease.</p><h2 id=canterbury-square-apartments-for-rent-in-richmond-va--forrentcom>Canterbury Square Apartments For Rent In Richmond, VA | ForRent.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#canterbury-square-apartments-for-rent-in-richmond-va--forrentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.forrent.com/i2/Q6Mnt-x1YvrqT7f0AXR_n7ebw5PO_m2JkiilGl-ExLQ/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xsVvIq7jfvhy6wCSuzMlFQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Canterbury Square Apartments For Rent in Richmond, VA | ForRent.com"><p><em>Source: forrent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>canterbury apartments square forrent tours 3d.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are one of the most popular types of housing in the United States.
