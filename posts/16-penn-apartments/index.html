In order to ensure the health and well-being of their tenants, landlords and property managers need to be on hand regularly to perform needed maintenance tasks. Here are four common ones:</p><ol><li><p>Updating your heating and cooling systems: Heat and air conditioning can be expensive to maintain, so it’s important that your landlords or property managers are kept up to date on the latest repairs. Regularly checking for new leaks, fixing broken parts, and replacing filters can all help keep your unit habitable.</p></li><li><p>Cleaning and painting: Keeping your building spick and span means cleaning every nook and cranny – from the landing boards to the toilet seats – every week or so.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/uncategorized/>Uncategorized</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/valley-oak-park-apartments-santa-rosa/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Valley Oak Park Apartments Santa Rosa - Petaluma Avenue Homes Sebastopol Income Low Apartments</span></a>
