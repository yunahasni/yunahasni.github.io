-Choosing the right apartment can be a daunting task. Here are five tips to help make the decision easier:
-Check out the location. Are you looking for a traditional downtown area, or a more suburban setting? This will affect your budget and what kind of amenities you&rsquo;re interested in.
-Think about your needs. Do you want an open plan living space, or do you want additional bedroom and/or kitchenette space? This will affect the price of your accommodation and how much utilities you&rsquo;ll need to pay.
-Consider what size unit you need. Do you want one that&rsquo;s large enough for all of your needs, or do you want something that&rsquo;s smaller but with more features?</p><h2 id=beacon-apartments-rentals---north-east-md--apartmentscom>Beacon Apartments Rentals - North East, MD | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beacon-apartments-rentals---north-east-md--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/Rx_wQUnLjTHFVLKFhApA6bePJsEEjmH9VbBmoisA47o/117/beacon-apartments-north-east-md-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NaZgqhAphtJzqAJ7OpznfgHaE1&pid=15.1"' alt="Beacon Apartments Rentals - North East, MD | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>beacon.</p></blockquote><p>Location of apartments: Where to live and what to expect when moving in
