As the population continues to grow, so does the need for apartments. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a one-bedroom or two- bedrooms, there are plenty of options to choose from. However, which apartment is right for you can be difficult to determine. Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=apartment>Apartment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartment>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://thornburgrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC01236.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.V4AK3AbYVSCQU84Sy96EdgHaE6&pid=15.1"' alt=Apartment><p><em>Source: thornburgrealty.com</em></p><blockquote><p>soon coming unit inside 1131 sw avenue 3rd.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartment buildings:
