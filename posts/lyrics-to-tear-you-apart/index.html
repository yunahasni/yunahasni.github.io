Looking for a safe place to live? pamper yourself with the perfect apartment for your needs. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a one-bedroom or two-bedroom, an online platform like Airbnb can provide you with rental listings in your area. With so many choices to choose from, it&rsquo;s important to be sure that the property you&rsquo;re considering is reputable and has secure locks and alarms. Here are five tips to help make sure your new apartment is just as safe as possible: 1. Do your research before making a purchase. Don&rsquo;t let someone else take advantage of your naiveté and tell you that because their property is &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; it must be too. Check out the ratings of the apartments in your area on real estate websites like Zillow and Gletto, then compare prices and features before making a decision. 2.</p><h2 id=love-would-tear-us-apart---youtube>Love Would Tear Us Apart - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#love-would-tear-us-apart---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PiyftGREHR4/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.gHXVqYVC9q0M-M8KMffD5AHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Love Would Tear Us Apart - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Bathrooms: Size and layout affects number of bathrooms.
