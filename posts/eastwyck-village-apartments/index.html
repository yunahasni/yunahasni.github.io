The traditional &ldquo;boxy&rdquo; buildings are being replaced by more slender and elongated buildings. This change has had a significant impact on the concentration of population and businesses in certain areas of the city. Additionally, the use of glass and steel in apartment windows has made it difficult to see out from an apartment window, making it less inviting for residents.</p><p>Despite these challenges, there is still plenty of room for growth in the apartment market.</p><h2 id=jamestown-commons-for-adults-55-apartments-for-rent-in-virginia-beach>Jamestown Commons For Adults 55+ Apartments For Rent In Virginia Beach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#jamestown-commons-for-adults-55-apartments-for-rent-in-virginia-beach>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.forrent.com/i2/rt7S2GMyLcKRNrDR5Cxr9_ZzQvJ918cJZKUHacu0yag/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6krQTuPgtJAfKuNH6zYbLwHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Jamestown Commons for Adults 55+ Apartments For Rent in Virginia Beach"><p><em>Source: forrent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>jamestown adults commons forrent tours 3d.</p></blockquote><p>apartment buildings, much like their predecessors, have been a part of the American landscape for over a century.
