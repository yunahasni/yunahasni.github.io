One of the first apartment buildings was built in Athens, Greece in 776 BC. This apartment building consisted of two stories with a large courtyard in the center. The courtyard was used as a public square and also served as an exercise ground for the city’s citizens. A few decades later, the Roman Republic built their own apartment buildings. These apartment buildings were much larger than their Greek predecessors and had large courtyards inside them. One of the most famous Roman apartments was the Colosseum, which housed up to 50,000 people at once.\nEventually, apartments became quite popular in Europe.
