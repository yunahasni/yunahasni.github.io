The main reason you should choose an apartment over a dormitory or house is the convenience factor. An apartment has everything you need right at your fingertips, making it easier to get around and have everything you need right there in your own space. Additionally, apartments often come with more features than dormitories or houses, making them better choices for those who want to live alone or with others.</p><h2 id=14925-hubbard-st-sylmar-ca-91342---3-bed-2-bath-single-family-home>14925 Hubbard St, Sylmar, CA 91342 - 3 Bed, 2 Bath Single-Family Home<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#14925-hubbard-st-sylmar-ca-91342---3-bed-2-bath-single-family-home>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.trulia.com/pictures/thumbs_6/zillowstatic/fp/6e6e2ea97c96c5bf63d154ddc6605fd9-full.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MkRGdvRakco1gcSNVrgwwgHaFt&pid=15.1"' alt="14925 Hubbard St, Sylmar, CA 91342 - 3 Bed, 2 Bath Single-Family Home"><p><em>Source: trulia.com</em></p><blockquote><p>sylmar hubbard.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a great addition to any city.
