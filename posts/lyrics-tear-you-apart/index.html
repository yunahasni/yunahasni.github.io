There are a variety of apartments available in the city. They can be classified based on their function, size, and exterior design. Here are four examples:</p><ol><li>Houses- These are typically small, two- or three-bedroom apartments that sit on a small plot of land. Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. They&rsquo;re perfect for people who want to live close to the center of town but don&rsquo;t need all the amenities that condos offer.</li></ol><h2 id=you039re-tearing-me-apart---room-334-1>You're Tearing Me Apart - Room 334<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you039re-tearing-me-apart---room-334-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dRekIRoZHDM/UBbvetODCGI/AAAAAAAAA78/AuJCJKLdQEs/s640/7671670484_5bc4818f4d_k.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._af9c4jWyK7Ep5YB7K9YYwHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="You're tearing me apart - Room 334"><p><em>Source: room-334.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of living in an apartment:
