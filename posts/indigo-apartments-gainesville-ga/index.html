A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.\n","wordCount":"1459","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-12-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jaylon Anderson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/indigo-apartments-gainesville-ga/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"yunahasni","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yunahasni.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://yunahasni.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Indigo Apartments Gainesville Ga : The Indigo Apartments For Rent In Atlanta, Ga</h1><div class=post-description>Gainesville indigo fl hotel</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-12-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 21, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1459 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jaylon Anderson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-bedroom-apartments-gainesville-ga--one-bedroom-apartments-for-rent>1 Bedroom Apartments Gainesville Ga : One Bedroom Apartments For Rent</a></li><li><a href=#hotel-indigo-gainsville-ga---28-improved-my-design-in-one-easy-lesson>Hotel Indigo Gainsville Ga -

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/uncategorized/>Uncategorized</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/hudson-northridge-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hudson Northridge Apartments : Apartments Hudson Raleigh Nc</span></a>
