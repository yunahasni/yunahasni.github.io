In order to keep your apartment safe, make sure to take some measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Here are some of the most common security features that apartments typically have:</p><ol><li><p>Doors and windows: Make sure all your doors and windows are locked from the inside or outside. This will help you stay safe while you&rsquo;re home and prevent anyone from entering without permission.</p></li><li><p>Security cameras: If you have any security cameras in your apartment, make sure they&rsquo;re working properly and displaying live video footage of the area. This will help you spot anything that&rsquo;s not right and can help you report any suspicious activity to the police or management soon after it happens.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=apartments-for-rent-in-berthoud-co---360-rentals--apartmentguidecom>Apartments For Rent In Berthoud, CO - 360 Rentals | ApartmentGuide.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-for-rent-in-berthoud-co---360-rentals--apartmentguidecom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_336,h_280,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/a31ac06156942e51d18e3f61a9f63499 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PUUwFwKP5GvF-Ut8AtHktwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments for Rent in Berthoud, CO - 360 Rentals | ApartmentGuide.com"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>berthoud.</p></blockquote><p>Rent vs. buying an apartment:
