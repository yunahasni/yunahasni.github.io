-A landlord is not limited to one type of apartment, and can evict a tenant for any reason.
-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=no57-holm-apartment--self-catering-in-inverness--gael-holiday-homes>No57 Holm Apartment | Self-catering In Inverness | Gael Holiday Homes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no57-holm-apartment--self-catering-in-inverness--gael-holiday-homes>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.gaelholidayhomes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sheneval_Apartment_Livingroom6-720x480.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Fdaz8Qlyszfo6thf4WufMwHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="No57 Holm Apartment | Self-catering in Inverness | Gael Holiday Homes"><p><em>Source: gaelholidayhomes.co.uk</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance and repairs:
