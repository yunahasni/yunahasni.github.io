There are a variety of apartments available in the city. They can be classified based on their function, size, and exterior design. Here are four examples:</p><ol><li>Houses- These are typically small, two- or three-bedroom apartments that sit on a small plot of land. Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. They&rsquo;re perfect for people who want to live close to the center of town but don&rsquo;t need all the amenities that condos offer.</li></ol><h2 id=rent-musical-research-task---music-process-journal>RENT Musical Research Task - Music Process Journal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rent-musical-research-task---music-process-journal>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://themusicprocessjournal2.weebly.com/uploads/6/7/3/6/67363623/rent-bway-02_orig.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.HTbcDmfui2GjT72k5MlBaAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="RENT musical research task - Music process journal"><p><em>Source: themusicprocessjournal2.weebly.com</em></p><blockquote><p>rent musical theatre stage broadway sets urban jonathon larson scene clay tell story help.</p></blockquote><p>Security concerns for tenants:
