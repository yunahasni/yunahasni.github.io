Here are four keytypes of apartment landlords:</p><ol><li><p>Tenant-in-possession (TIP): These landlords take on the responsibility of managing the property on behalf of their tenants. This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/uncategorized/>Uncategorized</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/cross-creek-apartments-beaufort-sc/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cross Creek Apartments Beaufort Sc : Cross Creek</span></a>
