Here are a few tips to help you make the best decision for your next apartment:</p><ol><li><p>Look at the surrounding neighborhood: As soon as you see all of the apartments in a building, you’ll want to know what types of amenities are available and how close they are to each other. Make sure you’re interested in any of the features that may be available, such as pool or gym membership.</p></li><li><p>Consider your budget: Just as important as location is budget. Make sure you understand what all of the specifics cost before making your purchase. This will allow you to have more control over what kind of apartment you end up choosing.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=forest-village-apartments---eugene-or--apartmentscom>Forest Village Apartments - Eugene, OR | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#forest-village-apartments---eugene-or--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/YhknFmuxO8mw53HdcGNfXXu3ZLevoJBkakn0Hsko51g/111/forest-village-apartments-eugene-or-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PVWZWwd0UEiNnCvuFiIrnAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Forest Village Apartments - Eugene, OR | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>eugene apartments village forest foxtail dr oregon rentals doorsteps rent.</p></blockquote><p>Tips for choosing the right apartment
