An apartment is a great place to live. It&rsquo;s often affordable, has a variety of amenities and features, and can be customized to fit your needs. However, there are a few things you should keep in mind when looking for an apartment.
First, make sure the building you&rsquo;re interested in is one that is close to public transportation.
