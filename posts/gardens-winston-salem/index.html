Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=gardens-at-country-club---43-reviews--winston-salem-nc-apartments-for>Gardens At Country Club - 43 Reviews | Winston-Salem, NC Apartments For<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gardens-at-country-club---43-reviews--winston-salem-nc-apartments-for>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/650x350_85-1/2/7/7/277372811083851027071.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.AzJLyVeH-31NBi7XwCzBVwHaD_&pid=15.1"' alt="Gardens at Country Club - 43 Reviews | Winston-Salem, NC Apartments for"><p><em>Source: apartmentratings.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartmentratings salem.</p></blockquote><p>Condition of units: Can apartments be dirty or clean?
