However, which apartment is right for you can be difficult to determine. Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget.
