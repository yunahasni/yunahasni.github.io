Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=122-fort-evans-rd-se-a-leesburg-va---2-bed-2-bath-condo---14-photos>122 Fort Evans Rd SE #A, Leesburg, VA - 2 Bed, 2 Bath Condo - 14 Photos<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#122-fort-evans-rd-se-a-leesburg-va---2-bed-2-bath-condo---14-photos>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.trulia.com/pictures/thumbs_5/zillowstatic/fp/9d5e30430eb781ebd21fddd7ea557d5e-full.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3Cps_SuF0IqNSMrwsNkbmQHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="122 Fort Evans Rd SE #A, Leesburg, VA - 2 Bed, 2 Bath Condo - 14 Photos"><p><em>Source: trulia.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Different types of apartments for different purposes:
