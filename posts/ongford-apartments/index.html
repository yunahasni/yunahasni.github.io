Size Location Features Appliances\nAn apartment can be a great place to call home. With plenty of room to spare, it can be difficult to find an affordable place to live. However, by knowing the attributes of an apartment, you can make the best decision for your needs. An apartment’s size is important, as it affects how much room you’re able to use. For example, a studio may have less space than a one-bedroom. In order to find an apartment that will fit your needs and budget, consider the size of the property and its surrounding area.

But what everyone should keep in mind is that the optimal layout for an apartment also depends on the type of apartment and its specific needs.

This includes the building entrance, lobbies, corridors and elevators.\nMake your apartments smell fresh: When you open an apartment door, make sure it smells like new paint or a fresh coat of disinfectant. This will add to the feeling of being home.\nMaintain appliances and countertops: Keep appliances such as ovens and dishwashers working properly by regularly cleaning them using a cleaner and duster solution. Do the same for countertops - be sure to use a durable surface that won’t show wear soon.\n","wordCount":"1034","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-11-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-11-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jaycee Haag"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/ongford-apartments/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"yunahasni","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yunahasni.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://yunahasni.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Ongford Apartments ~ Photos And Video Of Ongford Apartments In Portland, Or</h1><div class=post-description>Apartments emporis facade eastern</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-11-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 6, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1034 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jaycee Haag</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#ongford---regency---pine-cone-apartments---portland-or-97201>Ongford - Regency - Pine Cone Apartments - Portland, OR 97201</a></li><li><a href=#ongford-apartments-rentals---portland-or--apartmentscom>Ongford Apartments Rentals - Portland, OR | Apartments.com</a></li><li><a href=#photos-and-video-of-ongford-apartments-in-portland-or>Photos And Video Of Ongford Apartments In Portland, OR</a></li><li><a href=#ongford-apartments-1417-sw-10th-ave-portland-or---rentcafé>Ongford Apartments, 1417 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR - RENTCafé</a></li><li><a href=#ongford-apartments-1417-sw-10th-ave-portland-or---rentcafé-1>Ongford Apartments, 1417 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR - RENTCafé</a></li><li><a href=#ongford-apartments-portland--267642--emporis>Ongford Apartments, Portland | 267642 | EMPORIS</a></li><li><a href=#photos-and-video-of-ongford-apartments-in-portland-or-1>Photos And Video Of Ongford Apartments In Portland, OR</a></li><li><a href=#ongford---regency---pine-cone-apartments---portland-or-97201-1>Ongford - Regency - Pine Cone Apartments - Portland, OR 97201</a></li><li><a href=#ongford-apartments-1417-sw-10th-ave-portland-or---rentcafé-2>Ongford Apartments, 1417 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR - RENTCafé</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>What is an apartment?
