There are many types of landlords, depending on what type of apartment they are evicting.
Tenants who live in apartments should be aware of the following:
-A landlord is not limited to one type of apartment, and can evict a tenant for any reason.
-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=vinas-apartments-السعودية-الرياض---bookingcom-2>Vinas Apartments (السعودية الرياض) - Booking.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vinas-apartments-السعودية-الرياض---bookingcom-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://q-ec.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1024x768/172/17294519.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ZQpVgNMt1vMbyPivnSakzQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Vinas Apartments (السعودية الرياض) - Booking.com"><p><em>Source: booking.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Three bedroom apartments:
