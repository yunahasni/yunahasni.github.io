As the population continues to grow, so does the need for apartments. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a one-bedroom or two- bedrooms, there are plenty of options to choose from. However, which apartment is right for you can be difficult to determine. Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=sundance-west-apartments---costa-mesa-ca--apartmentscom-1>Sundance West Apartments - Costa Mesa, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sundance-west-apartments---costa-mesa-ca--apartmentscom-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/E57vkn-S0OC6KR8c1I82l2f0q1B9BxRv0WF-s_h3Ebs/111/sundance-west-costa-mesa-ca-grounds.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.069OgXA288hJ1nyq-Mi7LgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Sundance West Apartments - Costa Mesa, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Location: What are the benefits of living in an apartment?
