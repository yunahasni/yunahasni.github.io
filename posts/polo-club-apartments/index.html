According to the RENTCafé study, the average monthly rent for an apartment is $2,878. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s equivalent to the rent for a one-bedroom in most cities. However, there are a variety of factors that could affect an individual’s monthly budget and rent payment. For example, location could be a determining factor when looking to buy an apartment.

In order to keep your apartment safe, make sure to take some measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Here are some of the most common security features that apartments typically have:</p><ol><li><p>Doors and windows: Make sure all your doors and windows are locked from the inside or outside.
