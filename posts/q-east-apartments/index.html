Location is key – try to find an apartment that is close to a major shopping area or transportation hubs. This will make it easier for you to get around and access all the resources that you need.</p><p>Size is also important – select an apartment that is at least double the size of what you currently live in. This will give you more space and freedom than you would have if you were living in a smaller unit.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://yunahasni.github.io/tags/uncategorized/>Uncategorized</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yunahasni.github.io/posts/heritage-station-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Heritage Station Apartments - Cb1 Cambridge</span></a>
