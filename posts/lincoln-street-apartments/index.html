Since the early days of apartment buildings, they have been designed to be luxurious and inviting, making them ideal for those who desire privacy and comfort. A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel. Additionally, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in London was one of the first buildings to be occupied by tenants with apartments on top.</p><p>In recent years, apartment buildings have become even more popular, with many people looking for an affordable lifestyle closer to their work or home.</p><h2 id=66-west-38th-street-rentals--atlas-new-york--apartments-for-rent-in>66 West 38th Street Rentals | Atlas New York | Apartments For Rent In<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#66-west-38th-street-rentals--atlas-new-york--apartments-for-rent-in>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://luxuryrentalsmanhattan.com/sites/default/files/images/Building_Archstone_Murray_Hill_245_East_40th_Street_Rental_Apartment_1_0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0Z1I58K_8gTVqxzO60AWqAHaLH&pid=15.1"' alt="66 West 38th Street rentals | Atlas New York | Apartments for rent in"><p><em>Source: luxuryrentalsmanhattan.com</em></p><blockquote><p>york murray hill tower atlas street apartment building apartments west luxuryrentalsmanhattan east buildings luxury rental rent 38th manhattan 40th midtown.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments Near Me:
