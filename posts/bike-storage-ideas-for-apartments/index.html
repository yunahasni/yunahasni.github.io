Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=guest-apartment--bike-storage-bike-room-bicycle-storage>Guest Apartment | Bike Storage, Bike Room, Bicycle Storage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#guest-apartment--bike-storage-bike-room-bicycle-storage>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ec/04/09/ec040914fb0da3a1919042861265d847--basement-apartment-house-art.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.u-JAMUKnqmI1oEaWaQw79gAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Guest apartment | Bike storage, Bike room, Bicycle storage"><p><em>Source: br.pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of apartments:
