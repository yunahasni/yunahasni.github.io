A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=harolds-square-apartments---ithaca-ny--apartmentscom>Harolds Square Apartments - Ithaca, NY | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harolds-square-apartments---ithaca-ny--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/u5EngdlGOnm685V0fJ3RypsO6IKo9LWq-XbK9B4yLNI/117/harolds-square-ithaca-ny-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.p98-yp6myfe4pVeiYGSWgQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Harolds Square Apartments - Ithaca, NY | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>harolds ithaca.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that can be found in many different places around the world.
